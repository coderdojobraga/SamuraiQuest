# SamuraiQuest

SamuraiQuest is a Discord bot created for the CoderDojo Braga community. Its purpose is to simplify member onboarding, manage challenge submissions, and handle role assignments based on user reactions. SamuraiQuest helps to keep the server organized and enhances interaction between mentors and ninjas.

## Features

- **Welcome Message**: Automatically welcomes new members and guides them through initial steps on the server.
- **Role Assignment**: Allows members to select roles based on the type of challenges they prefer, like Scratch or Python.
- **Challenge Management**: Processes challenge submissions in Scratch and Python, updating a status message to track participant progress.
- **Emoji Reactions**: Adds and removes roles based on users' reactions to specific messages.
- **Rank Management**: Allows mentors to promote ninjas by assigning roles for achieved ranks.
